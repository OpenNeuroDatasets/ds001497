Install
-------
These scripts are meant to be used from within the `BIDS/sourcedata`
directory, so copy or move them there.

Usage
-----
All `.sh` files can be sourced from `bash` or `zsh`.
All `.py` files can be source with python3.

Dependencies
------------
`bids_anat_deface.sh` depends on `pydeface`, which depends on `fsl` and
the python packages `nibabel`, `nipype`, and `numpy`.
